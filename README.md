## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in understanding the characteristics of your dataset. It involves summarizing main characteristics of the data, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. Once you have a solid understanding of your data, feature engineering comes into play. Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.

## EDA

### Descriptive Statistics

Explore the basic statistics of your dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, and more. Understanding the central tendencies and dispersions can provide insights into the distribution of your data.

### Data Visualization

Visualize your data using various charts such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. Visualization helps in identifying patterns, trends, and potential outliers.

### Missing Values

Address missing values in your dataset. Analyze the extent of missingness and decide on appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.

## Feature Engineering

### Creating New Features

Generate new features that might capture important information in your dataset. This could involve combining existing features, creating interaction terms, or extracting meaningful information.

### Transformations

Apply mathematical transformations to your features to make them more suitable for modeling. Common transformations include logarithmic transformations or scaling.

### Handling Categorical Variables

Convert categorical variables into a format that can be easily interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This may involve one-hot encoding, label encoding, or other techniques.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks provided. Each notebook corresponds to a specific aspect of EDA or Feature Engineering. Follow the step-by-step instructions and adapt them to your own dataset.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/eda-feature-engineering.git
cd eda-feature-engineering
```
